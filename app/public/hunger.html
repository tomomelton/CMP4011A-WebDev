          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>
            Goal 2 is about creating a world free of hunger by 2030. The global
            issue of hunger and food insecurity has shown an alarming increase
            since 2015, a trend exacerbated by a combination of factors
            including the pandemic, conflict, climate change, and deepening
            inequalities
          </p>
          <p>
            People experiencing moderate food insecurity are typically unable to
            eat a healthy, balanced diet on a regular basis because of income or
            other resource constraints.

        <article class="center-text text2">
          <h1>Guidelines</h1>
          <p>
            Food security requires a multi-dimensional approach – from social
            protection to safeguard safe and nutritious food especially for
            children to transforming food systems to achieve a more inclusive
            and sustainable world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Investment in the agriculture sector is critical for reducing hunger
            and poverty, improving food security, creating employment and
            building resilience to disasters and shocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, with hunger limiting human development, we will not be
            able to achieve the other sustainable development goals such as
            education, health and gender equality.

          <h1>Key Facts</h1>
          <p>
            Shockingly, the world is back at hunger levels not seen since 2005,
            and food prices remain higher in more countries than in the period
            2015–2019. Along with conflict, climate shocks, and rising cost of
            living, civil insecurity and declining food production have all
            contributed to food scarcity and high food prices.
